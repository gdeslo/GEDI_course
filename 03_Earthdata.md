# Earthdata Search by NASA

This R Markdown document provides instructions on how to create an account and use **Earthdata Search** by NASA. 

For the practical, you will only need your **Earthdata Login** credentials (username and password); you **must create an account** following the first steps in this document, but you do **not** need to search for your own data. However, if you have extra time during the practical or want to explore your own **region of interest (ROI)** in the future, you can follow the steps in the second section of this R Markdown file.

## Creating an Earthdata Account (Mandatory for the practical!)

If you already have an Earthdata account, you can skip this section.

To create an account:

## What is Earthdata Search?

**Earthdata Search** is an online tool developed by NASA that allows users to find, visualize, and download satellite and environmental data. It provides access to a wide range of datasets related to **land cover, climate, vegetation, atmospheric conditions, and more**.  

With Earthdata Search, you can:
- Browse and filter datasets from multiple NASA missions.
- Search for data based on location, time range, and data type.
- Preview and download datasets for further analysis.
- Integrate the data with R or other geospatial analysis tools.

## Searching and Downloading GEDI Data (Optional for exploration)

Now that you have an account and understand the basics, you can explore how to search and download data for your own **region of interest (ROI)**. Note that this is **not required for the practical** but only for your own exploration after the practical or if you want an extra challenge!

1. Go to [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/).  
2. In the **"Search for collections or topics"** search bar, enter **GEDI**, then click on **Instrument â†’ GEDI**.

3. Zoom into your **ROI** and on the right-hand side, click **Search by rectangle/polygon/circle**.

4. **Draw a shape** over your ROI to define the search area.

5. You have now selected data only within your ROI. Choose the dataset you are interested in.  
   - In this practical, we use **GEDI L2B data**, but you can also select **L4A data**, which provides biomass information, **L2A data**, **L1A data**...  
   - This will now display **GEDI orbits** that pass over your ROI.

6. Select the orbit(s) you are interested in by clicking the **"+" sign (Add granule to project)**.  
   - You can add multiple orbits as needed.  
   - Once you have selected your orbits, click **Download**.

7. In the download window, make sure **"Download all data"** is selected, then click **Done**, followed by **Download Data**.

8. This will take you to a download page. Do **not** click Download. Instead, **copy the link** of the granule and update the download link in the [Jupyter Notebook of the practical](https://github.com/gdeslo/GEDI_course/blob/main/04_GEDI_L2B_notebook.ipynb).
