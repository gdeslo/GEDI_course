## **Questions for better understanding GEDI Data**
Solve these questions for yourself and passing the exam might become easier...

### 3. Visualise a GEDI orbit

- How does the spatial distribution of GEDI shots relate to the ISS orbit path? Why do they appear in a narrow strip?

### 4. Work with GEDI L2B data
   - What do you notice about the axes for elevation? How does this affect the way PAVD is displayed?
   - Why do the two plots have different elevation ranges? What does this tell us about the two shots?
   - If we had used the same y-axis limits for both graphs, what would change?
   - Which regions in the plot have the highest PAVD values? What does this mean in terms of canopy structure?
   - Is the PAVD distribution continuous or patchy? Why might this be the case?
   - How does the PAVD vary with elevation? Is there a pattern you can identify?
   - The PAVD is color-coded using a gradient from light green to dark green. What does a darker color indicate?
   - Does the color scale influence how you interpret the data? If so, how?
   - If we used a different colormap (e.g., ‘Reds’ instead of ‘Greens’), how might that affect interpretation?
   - What could cause one shot to have higher PAVD values at certain elevations than the other?
   - How do these profiles relate to forest structure? Can you infer anything about canopy height or density?
   - If you were collecting more data, what other variables would you want to include for a better understanding of PAVD?

**Extra**: Using what you've learned, describe what you would expect to see in a PAVD profile for:
   - A dense tropical rainforest
   - An open savanna
   - A recently logged forest

### 5. Work with GEDI L2B Beam Transects
- Do you notice any patterns in the canopy height across the transect?  
- What could be the cause of the sharp peaks and valleys in the graph?  
- Are there sections of the graph where canopy height is more consistent? What might this indicate about the underlying terrain or vegetation?  
- The plot appears "messy" with scattered points. What might be causing this?  
- Could some of these low canopy height values be from non-vegetated surfaces (e.g., roads, water bodies)?  
- What kinds of errors or uncertainties might be present in GEDI measurements? How can filtering (e.g., using the quality flag) help?  
- If you plotted a different GEDI beam, would you expect to see similar patterns, or would they be different? Why?  
- How might the same transect look in a dense tropical forest versus an open savanna?  
- If you had access to ground-based LiDAR data, how could you validate the accuracy of these canopy height measurements? 


### 5.2 Plot of Beam Transects
- How does the **Tandem-X DEM** compare to the **GEDI-derived elevation**? What could explain any differences?  
- What does the **Canopy Top Elevation** represent, and how is it different from the other two variables?  
- Where in the transect do you see the highest canopy elevations? What could explain these peaks?  
- Do you notice areas where the Tandem-X DEM and GEDI-derived elevation diverge significantly? What might cause this discrepancy?  
- Are there sections where canopy height is consistently low or missing? What could this indicate about the landscape?  
- Looking at the x-axis, do you see any changes in terrain? Can you hypothesize what type of environment this transect might pass through (e.g., dense forest, open land, mountains)?  
- The plot is "messy" - what do you think causes this?  
- What role might terrain slope, dense vegetation, or surface water play in affecting these elevation measurements?  
- Could there be errors in the data? If so, how would you detect and correct them?  
- How might cloud cover or atmospheric conditions impact GEDI’s elevation and canopy height estimates?
- If you analyzed a different GEDI beam, how might this graph look different?  
- How do you expect elevation and canopy height patterns to change in a tropical rainforest compared to an open woodland?  
- If you were to analyze multiple transects, what trends would you look for to study forest structure on a larger scale?  

### 6. Plot Profile Transects
- What do the different lines and color intensities represent in this plot?
- How does setting the same y-axis for both plots improve the comparison between the two transects?
- What are the key differences between the left and right plots? What might be causing these differences?
- How does the difference between ground elevation and canopy top elevation inform us about the vegetation structure in a given area?
- Where do you observe the largest difference between these two lines? What might that indicate?
- How does the topography influence canopy height? Do you see patterns where forested areas follow terrain contours?
- How does the distribution of PAVD align with canopy height and terrain changes?
- Are there any regions where PAVD is high, but canopy height is low? What might cause this?
- In which areas do you see more variation in PAVD, and how does this relate to different forest types?
- What landscape or ecological factors might explain the differences observed between these two transects?
- How might these results differ in different ecosystems, such as a tropical rainforest versus a savanna?
- How can this type of visualization be used in forest monitoring and conservation planning?
- How could changes in these plots over time help detect forest degradation, regrowth, or land-use changes?


### 7. Spatial visualisation
- Do you notice any correlations between canopy height and elevation? What landscapes show the highest canopy heights?
- What variations in Plant Area Index (PAI) do you see along the transect? How might this relate to forest density?
- Are there regions where canopy height is low, but PAI is high? What could explain this?
- How could these maps help in identifying areas of deforestation or forest degradation?
- How could this data be integrated into forest conservation or carbon storage assessments?
- What are some potential errors or uncertainties in the GEDI data? How might atmospheric conditions or terrain features affect accuracy?
- If you had access to higher-resolution airborne LiDAR, how might it improve upon GEDI’s spatial coverage and detail?
