## **Questions for Understanding GEDI Mapping and Visualization**

### **Section 3.1: Creating a GeoDataFrame**
1. **Why do we convert latitude and longitude into a `shapely` geometry column? What advantages does this provide?**
2. **How does filtering GEDI shots (e.g., selecting every 100th shot) impact the analysis? What trade-offs are we making?**
3. **Why do we need to store GEDI shot numbers along with their coordinates? How does this help with data linking?**
4. **What is the purpose of the `l2b_quality_flag`, and why might we want to filter shots based on it?**
5. **What do you think would happen if we plotted the GEDI shots without converting them to a GeoDataFrame?**  
   *Hint: Consider how pandas vs. GeoPandas handle spatial data.*

### **Section 3.2: Visualizing GEDI Data on a Map**
6. **What can we learn from overlaying GEDI shots on a basemap? How does this help interpret the data?**
7. **Why do we add multiple layers to our map (e.g., Queensland boundary, QPRP plots, GEDI shots)?**
8. **How does the spatial distribution of GEDI shots relate to the ISS orbit path? Why do they appear in a narrow strip?**
9. **Why might some GEDI shots be located over water or non-forested areas?**
10. **What are some potential sources of spatial error in GEDI data, and how could they affect our interpretation?**
11. **If you wanted to analyze how GEDI data varies across different land cover types (e.g., forest vs. grassland), how would you modify the visualization?**
12. **What additional datasets might be useful to combine with GEDI shots for a more complete ecological analysis?**  
    *Hint: Think about climate, topography, or land cover data.*

### **Interactive Analysis with Leafmap**
13. **How does the ability to zoom in and inspect individual GEDI shots improve the analysis?**
14. **What are some advantages of using an interactive map instead of a static plot for visualizing GEDI data?**
15. **In the final visualization, why are some GEDI shots colored differently? How does this help in understanding data quality?**
16. **What insights can you gain from comparing the GEDI shot locations to the QPRP plots? What patterns stand out?**
17. **If you were conducting field validation, how would you use this map to plan your sampling locations?**

1. **Axes & Scaling**
   - What do you notice about the axes for elevation? How does this affect the way PAVD is displayed?
   - Why do the two plots have different elevation ranges? What does this tell us about the two shots?
   - If we had used the same y-axis limits for both graphs, what would change?

2. **PAVD Distribution**
   - Which regions in the plot have the highest PAVD values? What does this mean in terms of canopy structure?
   - Is the PAVD distribution continuous or patchy? Why might this be the case?
   - How does the PAVD vary with elevation? Is there a pattern you can identify?

3. **Data Representation**
   - The PAVD is color-coded using a gradient from light green to dark green. What does a darker color indicate?
   - Does the color scale influence how you interpret the data? If so, how?
   - If we used a different colormap (e.g., ‘Reds’ instead of ‘Greens’), how might that affect interpretation?

4. **Scientific Interpretation**
   - What could cause one shot to have higher PAVD values at certain elevations than the other?
   - How do these profiles relate to forest structure? Can you infer anything about canopy height or density?
   - If you were collecting more data, what other variables would you want to include for a better understanding of PAVD?

5. **Extra**: Using what you've learned, describe what you would expect to see in a PAVD profile for:
   - A dense tropical rainforest
   - An open savanna
   - A recently logged forest

- Do you notice any patterns in the canopy height across the transect?  
- What could be the cause of the sharp peaks and valleys in the graph?  
- Are there sections of the graph where canopy height is more consistent? What might this indicate about the underlying terrain or vegetation?  
- The plot appears "messy" with scattered points—what might be causing this?  
- Could some of these low canopy height values be from non-vegetated surfaces (e.g., roads, water bodies)?  
- What kinds of errors or uncertainties might be present in GEDI measurements? How can filtering (e.g., using the quality flag) help?  
- If you plotted a different GEDI beam, would you expect to see similar patterns, or would they be different? Why?  
- How might the same transect look in a **dense tropical forest** versus an **open savanna**?  
- If you had access to ground-based LiDAR data, how could you validate the accuracy of these canopy height measurements?  




## **Questions for Analyzing PAVD, Elevation, and Canopy Top Elevation Over Queensland**

### **1. Understanding the Visualization**
- What do the different lines and color intensities represent in this plot?
- How does setting the same y-axis for both plots improve the comparison between the two transects?
- What are the key differences between the left and right plots? What might be causing these differences?

### **2. Comparing Ground Elevation and Canopy Top Elevation**
- How does the difference between ground elevation and canopy top elevation inform us about the vegetation structure in a given area?
- Where do you observe the largest difference between these two lines? What might that indicate?
- How does the topography influence canopy height? Do you see patterns where forested areas follow terrain contours?

### **3. Patterns in PAVD (Plant Area Volume Density)**
- How does the distribution of PAVD align with canopy height and terrain changes?
- Are there any regions where PAVD is high, but canopy height is low? What might cause this?
- In which areas do you see more variation in PAVD, and how does this relate to different forest types?

### **4. Interpreting the Spatial Context**
- What landscape or ecological factors might explain the differences observed between these two transects?
- If you were tasked with selecting sites for a field campaign, how would you use this visualization to guide your decision?
- How might these results differ in different ecosystems, such as a tropical rainforest versus a savanna?

### **5. Practical Applications**
- How can this type of visualization be used in forest monitoring and conservation planning?
- What additional datasets might be useful to combine with this analysis to get a more complete picture of forest structure?
- How could changes in these plots over time help detect forest degradation, regrowth, or land-use changes?
