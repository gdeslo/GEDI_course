# Welcome to the GEDI practical repository.
This repository is for the Advanced Remote Sensing GEDI practical at UGhent.

In this practical you will learn to:
- Understand what GEDI is.
- Access GEDI data through Earth Data Search.
- Execute some python commands to read and visualise GEDI data.
- Understand graphs made using GEDI data.


This repository offers all files necessary to succesfully complete the practical.

In [the colab notebook](https://github.com/gdeslo/GEDI_course/blob/notebook/colab.md) you can find information, tips and tricks about Google Colab. We recommend using this Jupyter notebook environment to execute this practical. 

Open the [L2B notebook](https://github.com/gdeslo/GEDI_course/blob/notebook/GEDI_OZ_L2B_V2.ipynb) in Google Colab and save the [DATA folder](https://github.com/gdeslo/GEDI_course/tree/notebook/DATA) to your drive as follows `My Drive/Colab Notebooks/GEDI_course/DATA` . Read the info in the notebook, execute the code and try to solve the `üßê Questions to Think About`.

Good luck! üçÄ
