        "### This tutorial demonstrates how to work with the Canopy Cover and Vertical Profile Metrics ([GEDI02_B.002](https://doi.org/10.5067/GEDI/GEDI02_B.002)) data product.\n",
        "The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ([GEDI](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data/get-started-data/collection-overview/missions/gedi-overview/)) mission aims to characterize ecosystem structure and dynamics to enable radically improved quantification and understanding of the Earth's carbon cycle and biodiversity. The GEDI instrument produces high resolution laser ranging observations of the 3-dimensional structure of the Earth. GEDI is attached to the International Space Station and collects data globally between 51.6 N and 51.6 S latitudes at the highest resolution and densest sampling of any light detection and ranging (lidar) instrument in orbit to date. The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) distributes the GEDI Level 1 and Level 2 Version 1 and Version 2 products. The L1B and L2 GEDI products are archived and distributed in the HDF-EOS5 file format.\n",
